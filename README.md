 Using Big Data and Machine Learning applications to create advanced models to predict and
 detect different human emotions based on images. Making use of deep learning models and
 pre-trained models to create an application that will detect these emotions and could make
 use of it in the real world. Use Convolutional Neural Networks to identify the complex face
 emotions and segregate them into proper classes.
  The dataset is taken from the Kaggle website which consists of different images of human
 faces depicting human emotions. The dataset consists of 7 classes of which we only use 3
 classes. The main reason for using only 3 classes is because the dataset is highly imbalanced
 and creates a lot of noise. Processes like data augmentation will also still be less to handle the
 dataset.
 Another important thing is that the human emotions are very alike and similar looking to each
 other because of which the model might get confused. Also this will improve the
 performance of the model and reduce complexities. The data is divided into training and
 testing. The training dataset consists of 16040 total images and the testing consists of 3979
 images
